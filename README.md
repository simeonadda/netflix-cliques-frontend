# Netflix Cliques Backend 

This is the backend repository. 

## Project Description

Netflix Cliques allows for individuals across the world to connect with each other in “cliques” to share their thoughts on their latest Netflix fave. Think of how book clubs work, and now switch out the books for Netflix movies and series! It’s a great way for people to connect on the aspects of these movies/series that interest them. The latest hits, film scripts, videography, gossip, directors, or just plain fun.
